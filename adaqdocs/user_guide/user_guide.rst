About the user guide
--------------------

If you are reading this user guide for the first time it is strongly recommended 
that you read the user guide fully before experimenting with your own data files.

Much of the content has supplementary links to the reference documentation; 
you will not need to follow these links in order to understand the guide but 
they may serve as a useful reference for future exploration.
Since later pages depend on earlier ones, try reading this user guide 
sequentially using the next and previous links.
